## Plotting y aginast x

- To make a nice graph, we need to make appropriate choices including:
  - Ruling
  - Scale units
  - Kinds of grids
  - Plot shapes; and
  - Ticks and number along axes

## Subtraction

- For better illustration of the plots, we can use untilting to show residual, or we can do the subtraction by arithmetic to create straight lines
- Once the plot is straightened, we can usually gain much by flattering it, usually by plotting residuals
