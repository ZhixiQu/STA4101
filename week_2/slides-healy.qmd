# Making Good Visualization
## Section 1.3
- We perceive colour by contrast instead of the colour itself
- When choosing colour scheme, we want to choose colours on a scale that is perceptually uniform
- Use shape and colours 

## Section 1.4
- Three axes plots are harder to interpret compared to two axes
- Alignment of elements makes comparison easier

## Section 1.5
- For ordered variables, choice of sequence of colours is important
